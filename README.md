# QR Order
An app that was created in the COVID-19 pandemic to help people view food menus and order contactlessly from restaurants, thus minimising the risk of getting infected.
The app is an Android app coded in Java. Uses Google's material design along with the Code Scanner library by Yuri Budyiev. Sign-up and Sign-in is managed with Firebase 
authentication and FirebaseUI. The app scans QR codes using the Code Scanner Library, detecting your current restaurant and serving you the appropriate menu.
Your final order in the cart will be pushed to Google's Firebase Realtime Database as a JSON object.
